# ChainOfResponsibilityDesign
LLD for Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern


 This pattern is used to pass client requests along a chain of objects (‘handlers’) to be processed. Each link in the chain will decide whether to process the request or pass it along to the next in line. 

It’s like the phone operating system when you call your bank. You go through the options in the automated system, and if none are relevant you are connected with a customer service agent. They will either deal with your request or send you on to another department, and so on.
